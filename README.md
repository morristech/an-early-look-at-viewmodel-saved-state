# An Early Look at ViewModel SavedState

Demo code for the [article with the same title](https://an-early-look-at-viewmodel-savedstate/).

The different versions of the code can be run by changing the package of the `MainActivity` to be used in the manifest. (If someone wants to contribute a nicer solution, for example with build flavours for these, I'm open for PRs.)
